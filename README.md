# Planets-tablist

A simple practice project built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript — a tabbed interface (tablist) presenting information about different planets. Great for practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 📁 Project Structure

/index.html — main HTML file
/styles.css — styling for layout and tabs
/script.js — JavaScript for tab switching behavior

## 📝 Usage / How it Works

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click on the planet names (tabs) to switch between different planets.
3. The content area updates to show information about the selected planet.

If you want to add more planets:

- Add a new tab element in the HTML.
- Add a corresponding content panel.
- Update your JS logic to handle the new tab + panel (or refactor for scalability).

## 🎯 Features / What you practiced

- Basic semantic HTML structure.
- CSS for styling tab layout and active tab states.
- JavaScript for event handling, DOM selection/manipulation, and dynamic UI updates.
- Separation of concerns: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JS for behavior.

## ✨ Possible Improvements / To-Do

- Make the tablist accessible — support keyboard navigation (e.g. arrow keys), `aria-` attributes, focus management.
- Add transition/animation when switching tabs for smoother UX.
- Add more content per planet — e.g. images, additional facts.
- Make the UI responsive, so it works well on mobile screens.
- Use a data structure (e.g. an array or object) to define planets and render tabs + panels dynamically (reduces manual HTML duplication).
